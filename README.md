# DistributedStateTest
Test app for experimenting with a distributed object app on [LiteNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib).

This is a .NET 3.5 application with unit testing, intended as an experimental testbed for
a distributed LAN system I'm working on that wants both reliable and unreliable peer-to-peer
networking, locally only.
